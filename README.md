# PythonProj
Python playground

While i embark on this journey of learning python, i decided to create a repository and try and mimic real life "packaging" style as much as i can even though the idea is just to try things out just to understand python and learn how to code in python. 

**In the future**, i will try and make it user centric where the user can type in what they want to try and see the outcome. 

**For now**, I have only implemented a file operation where data in the `input_file` is read and sorted in alphabetic order. While undergoing job search, i realised maintaining a list of jobs that have sent in a rejection email can get overwhelming, and chances are i might have applied to a job without realising i have done so already since LinkedIn, or any other job portal fails to show the update. Thus, sorting the file would make my life easier to glance through the list. In coming PRs/commits, I plan on adding a search functionality too, and thereby making it easier for me to maintain this list and search through them. ;). There's really no point in maintaining such a list but no harm if it helps me learn phython. WDYT?

This doesn't mimic a real life `README`.

Cheers!
